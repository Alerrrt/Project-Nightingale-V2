# Project Nightingale V2 - Comprehensive Codebase Review & Enhancement Plan

## Background and Motivation

The user has requested a comprehensive review and enhancement of the codebase with the following critical requirements:

**New Requirements (TO BE ADDRESSED):**
1. **Fix all unnecessary errors** - Identify and resolve any linting, runtime, or logical errors
2. **Remove all emojis from UI/UX** - Clean up any emoji usage in the interface
3. **Rewire any mapped out components** - Fix component routing and connections
4. **Clean unnecessary components/plugins/functions** - Remove dead code and unused functionality
5. **Fix PDF export with live data** - Ensure PDF generation works with real-time scan reports
6. **Implement progressive UI reveal** - Show only scanning bar initially, then reveal full UI after scan starts
7. **Fix scanner pausing issues** - Patch scanner efficiency and prevent unnecessary pauses
8. **Improve real-time data mapping** - Ensure precise, real-time vulnerability mapping with duplicate removal

These requirements focus on code quality, user experience, and system efficiency improvements.
