# Project Nightingale V2 - Troubleshooting Plan

## Background and Motivation

The user has identified multiple critical issues that need immediate attention:

**Original Issues (COMPLETED):**
1. **Hover Message Issue**: Live Module Status cards lack informative hover messages about scanner types and OWASP vulnerabilities they detect
2. **UX Lag and Connection Issues**: Scans are experiencing lag and require connection cutoffs to complete, indicating performance and completion logic problems
3. **Backend Scanner Pauses**: Scanners have unexplained pauses in the backend, preventing real-time vulnerability mapping

**New Issues (TO BE ADDRESSED):**
4. **Scan Timing Accuracy**: Progress bar needs accurate scan timings
5. **Scanner Initialization**: Scanners should be initialized at startup
6. **PDF Download Error**: Real-time PDF data download is failing
7. **Scan Termination Issues**: Scans terminate prematurely instead of waiting for all scanners to complete
8. **CWE/CVE Mapping**: Improper mapping of CWE and CVE information
9. **Log Analysis**: Need to analyze terminal logs and refer to screenshot for patching
10. **PDF Report Enhancement**: Integrate specific layout with pie charts, graphs, and functions from provided screenshot

These issues are affecting the core functionality and user experience of the security scanning platform.

## Key Challenges and Analysis

### Issue 1: Missing Hover Information (COMPLETED)
- **Root Cause**: ModuleStatusGrid component lacks detailed tooltip information about scanner capabilities
- **Impact**: Users cannot understand what each scanner does or what vulnerabilities it detects
- **Technical Details**: 
  - Current tooltip only shows status and error messages
  - No mapping between scanner names and their OWASP categories
  - Missing scanner metadata about vulnerability types

### Issue 2: UX Lag and Connection Cutoff Problems (COMPLETED)
- **Root Cause**: Multiple potential causes:
  - Inefficient real-time updates causing UI blocking
  - Scanner engine not properly handling completion states
  - WebSocket/SSE connection management issues
  - Memory leaks from accumulated scan data
- **Impact**: Poor user experience, incomplete scans, unreliable results
- **Technical Details**:
  - Scanner engine has complex async logic with multiple broadcast points
  - No proper cleanup of completed scans
  - Potential race conditions in status updates

### Issue 3: Backend Scanner Pauses (COMPLETED)
- **Root Cause**: 
  - Scanner concurrency management issues
  - Resource contention between scanners
  - Inefficient timeout handling
  - Potential deadlocks in async operations
- **Impact**: Delayed vulnerability detection, poor real-time performance
- **Technical Details**:
  - Scanner engine uses complex concurrency manager
  - Multiple timeout mechanisms (per-scanner and global)
  - Resource monitoring may be causing bottlenecks

### Issue 4: Scan Timing Accuracy (NEW)
- **Root Cause**: 
  - Progress bar calculations may not reflect actual scan progress
  - Timing estimates may be based on incomplete data
  - No real-time adjustment based on scanner performance
- **Impact**: Users cannot accurately predict scan completion times
- **Technical Details**:
  - Need to analyze current progress calculation logic
  - May need to implement adaptive timing based on scanner performance
  - Consider historical data for better estimates

### Issue 5: Scanner Initialization (NEW)
- **Root Cause**: 
  - Scanners are not pre-loaded at application startup
  - Initialization happens on-demand, causing delays
- **Impact**: First scan takes longer, poor user experience
- **Technical Details**:
  - Need to implement startup scanner loading
  - May need to optimize scanner discovery and registration
  - Consider lazy loading vs eager loading trade-offs

### Issue 6: PDF Download Error (NEW)
- **Root Cause**: 
  - Real-time PDF generation may have issues
  - Data streaming to PDF may be interrupted
  - PDF generation library may have compatibility issues
- **Impact**: Users cannot download scan reports
- **Technical Details**:
  - Need to investigate PDF generation endpoint
  - Check for data format issues
  - Verify PDF library dependencies

### Issue 7: Scan Termination Issues (NEW)
- **Root Cause**: 
  - Scans may have timeout mechanisms that terminate too early
  - Individual scanner failures may cause overall scan termination
  - Resource limits may be too restrictive
- **Impact**: Incomplete scan results, wasted time
- **Technical Details**:
  - Need to review scan timeout configurations
  - Implement graceful handling of individual scanner failures
  - Adjust resource limits appropriately

### Issue 8: CWE/CVE Mapping (NEW)
- **Root Cause**: 
  - Vulnerability data may not be properly mapped to CWE/CVE standards
  - Database or mapping logic may have issues
  - External CVE database connections may be failing
- **Impact**: Incomplete vulnerability information, poor reporting
- **Technical Details**:
  - Need to investigate CWE/CVE mapping logic
  - Check external API connections
  - Verify data format consistency

### Issue 9: Log Analysis (NEW)
- **Root Cause**: 
  - Need to analyze terminal logs for specific errors
  - Screenshot reference needed for visual context
- **Impact**: Cannot identify specific issues without log analysis
- **Technical Details**:
  - Awaiting user-provided logs and screenshot
  - Will need to correlate logs with code execution paths

### Issue 10: PDF Report Enhancement (NEW)
- **Root Cause**: 
  - PDF generation needs to match a specific dashboard layout from a screenshot
  - Pie charts, bar charts, and performance metrics need to be integrated
- **Impact**: PDF reports do not match the desired visual appearance
- **Technical Details**:
  - Awaiting user-provided screenshot for exact layout requirements
  - Need to analyze screenshot to understand specific elements to integrate
